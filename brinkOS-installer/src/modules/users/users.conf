# Configuration for the one-user-system user module.
#
# Besides these settings, the user module also places the following
# keys into the globalconfig area, based on user input in the view step.
#
# - hostname
# - username
# - password (obscured)
# - autologinUser (if enabled, set to username)
#
# These globalconfig keys are set when the jobs for this module
# are created.

# These are optional password-requirements that a distro can enforce
# on the user. The values given in this sample file disable each check,
# as if the check was not listed at all.
#
# Checks may be listed multiple times; each is checked separately,
# and no effort is done to ensure that the checks are consistent
# (e.g. specifying a maximum length less than the minimum length
# will annoy users).
#
# (additional checks may be implemented in UsersPage.cpp)
